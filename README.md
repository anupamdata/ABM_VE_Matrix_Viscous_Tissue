# ABM_VE_Matrix_Viscous_Tissue
This code is a written by Dr. Anupam Gupta. It is an agent based model. This code simulates the growth of viscous tissue encapsulated in a viscoelastic matrix. For more details reader can follow the manuscript "https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.19.476771".

'para.in' file contains all the input parameters to simulate the growth of the tissue in viscoelastic matrix. The viscosity of the matrix is controlled by paramter mu (line 18), the elasticisty of the matrix is controlles by Es (line 14), and the viscosity of the tissue is controlled by gm (line 17). The sample paramter that is shared here is to simulate a tissue that forms branches as it grows.
